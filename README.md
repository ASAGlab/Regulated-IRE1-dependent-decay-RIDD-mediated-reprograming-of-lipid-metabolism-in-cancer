# Regulated IRE1α-dependent decay (RIDD) mediated reprograming of lipid metabolism in cancer

This repository contains materials and methods for the paper "Regulated IRE1α-dependent decay (RIDD)-mediated reprograming of lipid metabolism in cancer" by Almanza*, Mnich* et al., (2021)

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this study, we employed unbiased lipidomic and transcriptomic approaches to investigate the contribution of IRE1α signalling to lipid metabolism in TNBC. This system biology framework enables the systematic exploration of regulation of metabolic pathways by IRE1α and represents a novel resource for the study of non-canonical IRE1α functions.
